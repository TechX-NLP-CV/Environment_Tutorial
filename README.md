# Intro

This is the tutorial for the environment setting of the TechX computer vision track which will help you set up everything you need for developing.


## What is Colab & Why Colab?
Colaboratory Platform, short for Colab, is a Integrated Developer Environment(IDE) developed by Google. It's also functions as the develop platform which we are going to write and test our code. A good weel could fascilliate developer on a great scale. Therefore, choosing a well-integrated IDE would be crucial. Colab, as an online IDE, outperforms many other local IDE on three aspects: easy to deploy, easy to config, various computation resources.

## Task One: VPN Dependency

Make sure you have a VPN service; thus, you can use google, colab, etc. For ones who don't have VPN, TBD.

## Task Two: Set up your Google Account

If you already have a Google account, please skip this task. If you don't have a google account, please follow the instruction explicitly and make sure all the settings are correct. Quick Link to [google account instruction](https://github.com/techx-cv/Environment_Tutorial/blob/main/instructions/Google%20Account%20Registration.pdf).

## Task Three: Set up your Colab

Now we can access Colab; Follow the instruction and create your own Colab notebook. Quick Link to [Colab setting instruction](https://github.com/techx-cv/Environment_Tutorial/blob/main/instructions/Google%20Colab%20Instruction.pdf)

## Task four: Advanced Setting in Colab

Now the basic configuration is all set. If you wanna know more about Colab, follow the additional instruction. Quick Link to [Advance config instruction]
