# Intro

This is the tutorial for the use of the Colaboratory Platform, short for Colab,provided by Google. This will function as the Integrated Developer Environment(IDE) in our track. This repo will teach you how to set up all requirements and configrations on your own Colab notebook.

## What is IDE & Why Colab?

To be short, IDE is the developing tool where developers implement and test their code. Therefore, choosing a well-integrated IDE would be crucial. Colab, as an online IDE, outperforms many other local IDE on three aspects: easy to deploy, easy to config, various computation resources.

## Task One: VPN Dependency

Make sure you have a VPN service; thus, you can use google, colab, etc. For ones who don't have VPN, TBD.

## Task Two: Set up your Google Account

If you already have a Google account, please skip this task. If you don't have a google account, please follow the instruction explicitly and make sure all the settings are correct. Quick Link to [google account instruction](https://github.com/techx-cv/Environment_Tutorial/blob/main/instructions/Google%20Account%20Registration.pdf).

## Task Three: Set up your Colab

Now we can access Colab; Follow the instruction and create your own Colab notebook. Quick Link to [Colab setting instruction](https://github.com/techx-cv/Environment_Tutorial/blob/main/instructions/Google%20Colab%20Instruction.pdf)

## Task four: Advanced Setting in Colab

Now the basic configuration is all set. If you wanna know more about Colab, follow the additional instruction. Quick Link to [Advance config instruction]
